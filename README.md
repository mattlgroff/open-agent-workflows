# open-agent-workflows
A proposal for an open standard for LLM Agent Workflows that isnâ€™t tied to a framework like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or AutoGen. 

# Product Requirements Document: Open Agent Workflows

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Open Agent Workflows is an open-source Python library designed to standardize the development, visualization, and monitoring of LLM-based agent workflows. It aims to provide a framework-agnostic solution that supports the OpenAI API standard while offering robust tools for workflow management and observability.

### 1.2 Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from:
- LlamaIndex Workflows: For its approach to structuring and managing complex LLM-based workflows
- LangGraph Studio UI: For its innovative approach to visualizing and interacting with agent graphs

### 1.3 Mindset
The core philosophy behind Open Agent Workflows is:
1. Openness: Create an open standard that isn't tied to any specific LLM framework
2. Simplicity: Provide an intuitive API that's easy to use without sacrificing power
3. Visibility: Offer clear insights into workflow structure and performance
4. Flexibility: Support a wide range of use cases and easy customization

## 2. Product Overview

Open Agent Workflows is a Python library that enables developers to:
- Define complex LLM-based workflows using a simple, declarative syntax
- Visualize workflow structures for better understanding and debugging
- Monitor and optimize workflow performance in production environments
- Integrate seamlessly with the OpenAI API and potentially other LLM providers

## 3. Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Core Workflow Management

#### 3.1.1 Workflow Definition
- **Requirement**: Provide a Pydantic-based class for defining workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can create `Workflow` objects with a name and a list of steps
  - Each step in the workflow is represented by a `Step` object
  - Steps can be of various types (e.g., LLM call, function execution, conditional branching)

#### 3.1.2 Workflow Execution
- **Requirement**: Implement a robust execution engine for running workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Workflows can be executed with a simple `run` method
  - The execution engine handles data flow between steps
  - Supports both sequential and parallel execution of steps
  - Provides proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### 3.2 LLM Integration

#### 3.2.1 OpenAI API Support
- **Requirement**: Seamless integration with the OpenAI API
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Provide an `LLMCall` step type that works with OpenAI's chat completions
  - Support all relevant parameters from the OpenAI API (model, temperature, etc.)
  - Handle API responses and errors gracefully

#### 3.2.2 Extensibility for Other LLM Providers
- **Requirement**: Design the LLM integration to be easily extensible
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Provide a base class or interface for LLM integrations
  - Document the process for adding support for new LLM providers

### 3.3 Visualization

#### 3.3.1 Static Workflow Visualization
- **Requirement**: Generate static visualizations of workflow structures
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Create graph-based visualizations using libraries like networkx and matplotlib
  - Clearly display step names, types, and connections
  - Provide options for customizing the visual appearance

#### 3.3.2 Interactive Workflow Visualization
- **Requirement**: Develop an interactive web-based visualization tool
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Create a D3.js-based visualization that allows zooming and panning
  - Enable users to click on steps to view details and configurations
  - Provide real-time updates during workflow execution

### 3.4 Observability

#### 3.4.1 Logging
- **Requirement**: Implement comprehensive logging throughout the library
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Log the start and completion of workflows and individual steps
  - Include relevant details such as input/output data and execution time
  - Allow easy integration with existing logging systems

#### 3.4.2 Metrics Collection
- **Requirement**: Collect and expose key performance metrics
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Track metrics such as workflow/step duration and execution counts
  - Use a standard metrics collection library (e.g., Prometheus client)
  - Provide easy export of metrics for monitoring systems

#### 3.4.3 Distributed Tracing
- **Requirement**: Implement distributed tracing for complex workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Generate unique trace IDs for each workflow execution
  - Capture timing and relationships between steps
  - Support integration with popular tracing systems (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)

### 3.5 User Interface

#### 3.5.1 Web-based Workflow Management UI
- **Requirement**: Develop a web interface for managing workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Allow users to create, edit, and delete workflows through a GUI
  - Provide a visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop functionality
  - Enable real-time monitoring of running workflows

#### 3.5.2 Debugging Tools
- **Requirement**: Implement tools for debugging workflows
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Allow users to pause, step through, and inspect workflow execution
  - Provide the ability to modify step inputs/outputs during debugging
  - Offer breakpoint functionality for complex workflows

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- The library should have minimal overhead on workflow execution
- Visualization and UI components should remain responsive for workflows with 100+ steps

### 4.2 Scalability
- Support execution of multiple workflows concurrently
- Handle workflows with a large number of steps (1000+) efficiently

### 4.3 Compatibility
- Support Python 3.7 and above
- Ensure compatibility with major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### 4.4 Security
- Implement secure handling of API keys and sensitive data
- Provide guidelines for secure deployment in production environments

### 4.5 Documentation
- Provide comprehensive API documentation
- Include tutorials and examples for common use cases
- Maintain a user guide for the web-based UI

## 5. Future Considerations

- Support for more complex workflow patterns (e.g., loops, dynamic step generation)
- Integration with popular MLOps platforms
- Development of a marketplace for sharing custom steps and workflows
- Mobile app for monitoring workflows on-the-go

## 6. Success Metrics

- Number of GitHub stars and forks
- Community contributions (pull requests, issues)
- Adoption by notable companies or projects
- Performance benchmarks against other workflow management solutions

This PRD outlines the key requirements and features for Open Agent Workflows, providing a roadmap for development and a clear vision for the project's goals and scope.
